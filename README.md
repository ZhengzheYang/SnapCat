# SnapCat
This is the project I've worked on during summer in LionMobi Holding Limited. This whole application is based on Tzutalin's Dlib algorithm. What I did was add a custom view on the screen to see the 67 points of face detection. Also, I added a recycler view to show several stickers by calculating the coordinates. The speed of face detection has been accelerated too.
